# Dotnet logger wrapper
Dotnet logger wrapper for fastest usage

## Why logger wrapper
- Dotnet has default logger, but has some limitations
-- too much nosiy
-- no persistant providers
-- no cloud providers
- need fasted usage
- need some builtin configure for plug & play
- need some additional data
- need some additional logger eg. activity, request with more data, error, audit trail etc.
